## Java 2D Game Engine with GLFW and ImGui

## The Objective

- To Create 2D game engine written in Java that utilizes GLFW for window management and ImGui for user interface elements. It provides a basic framework for creating 2D games and applications with an interactive GUI.

## Ongoing Development Tasks

    SpriteSheets

        - Write tests for the serialization and deserialization of a spritesheets with default attributes.

    Complete Dirty Flag System:

        - Finish and test the dirty flag system

    Implement Debug Drawing Features:

        - Begin development on debug drawing features to enhance the debugging capabilities of the application.
        - Define specific features, such as visualizing bounding boxes, collision shapes, or other relevant debug information.

    Construct Grid for Debugging:

        -Create a grid visualization as part of the debug drawing features to assist in debugging and aligning sprites.
        -Consider customizable options for the grid, such as cell size and color, to accommodate various debugging needs.
