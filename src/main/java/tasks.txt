Current Development Tasks

   Weekly Plan (March 4 - Mach 10)

       - Fix sprite duplication

       - Implement a details window for the active game object.

       - Implement functionality to allow a user to select objects once they have already been placed in the scene.

       - Review Editor Controls, Mouse control math and OrthoCamera math/controls carefully and record editor control details in notebook.

       - Fix the @Override method placement. All should be at the top. Stick to one convention
